<h1>Julian's Top 3 Movies</h1>

<h2>These movies are guarenteed to blow your mind</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>
  "Life is like a box of chocolates".<br />
  This iconic line will undoubtedly stick with you years after watching the
  film, as the protagonist Forrest easily maneavuers his way into your heart
  with his childlike innocence, humor, and compassion.
</p>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>
  A guarenteed classic if you're into mafia movies. The GOAT film for those
  wanting to get a taste of what it's like to be "el jefe". Interestingly
  enough, this film is also great for those who appreciate oranges.
  <br /><br />If you know you know.
</p>
<h3>Knives Out</h3>
<p>
  If you're like me and love trying to predict movies as you watch them, then
  this one is great for you. It's almost like playing the board game Clue, but
  in cinema form. Filled with humour and some great accents, it flawlessly broke
  into my top three.
