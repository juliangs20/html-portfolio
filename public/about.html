<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/Selfie.png" height="200" />

<p>
  Born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, in the United States of America - I am a
  devoted student of Java Full Stack development. I owe this newfound passion to
  the fact that I got a taste of the nomad lifestyle, during my time working as
  a language assistant in Madrid, Spain. I quickly fell in love with the country
  and the new challenges that came with it, and swore to myself that I am going
  to do everything in my power to one day call this place my home.
</p>

<p>
  Long story short, my plan to do so begins with mastering Java Full Stack
  coding, and earning the opportunity to work remotely for a company willing to
  sponsor me in Spain. Following the completion of this wonderful course put
  together by Angela Yu, I will work on more difficult projects to further
  develop my skills, while simultaneoulsy applying for junior developer
  positions.

  I am currently 24 years of age, and hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer
  Information Systems from Park University, Gilbert, Arizona. During my
  collegiate studies I took some introductory courses in coding for several
  languages such as Java, SQL, and HTML, so I believe I have a good foundation
  to really sharpen my craft. Since I graduated, I worked as an IT Support
  Anaylyst III at Grand Canyon University, before taking this opportunity to
  travel to Madrid, Spain, for a year to teach English. During this year I plan
  on refining my coding skills and learning Spanish to at least a B1 level of
  fluency!
